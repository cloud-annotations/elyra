    "The model we will be training is the SSD MobileNet architecture. SSD MobileNet models have a very small file size and can execute very quickly, compromising little accuracy, which makes it perfect for running in the browser. Additionally, we will be using `quantization`. When we say the model is `quantized` it means instead of using `float32` as the datatype of our numbers we are using `float16` or `int8`.\n",

    "We do this because it can cut our model size down by around a factor of 4! An unquantized version of SSD MobileNet that I trained was `22.3 MB`, but the quantized version was `5.7 MB` that's a `~75%` reduction ðŸŽ‰"
